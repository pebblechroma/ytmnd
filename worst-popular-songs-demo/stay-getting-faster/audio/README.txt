Justin Bieber ft. The Kid LAROI - Stay (Lyrics)

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (oh)
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'll be ****** up if you can't be right here
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)
Oh, I'll be ****** up if you can't be right here
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh-ooh)
You're the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh-ooh)
And I'm afraid that I'ma **** it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa)
I'll be ****** up if you can't be right here
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
Oh-oh-oh
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
